# Data Visualization Dashboard Project

Data Visualization Dashboard is a software system that converts raw data into graphical and visual reports such as charts, graphs, tables, maps, and KPI indicators. It helps users understand large amounts of data quickly and clearly.

Instead of reading rows and columns in spreadsheets, users can analyze information through visual elements.

A dashboard is widely used in companies, colleges, hospitals, banks, websites, and industries.

# 6. Theory Part

A dashboard collects data from files or databases and converts it into charts.

Example:

Sales table:

| Month | Sales |
| ----- | ----- |
| Jan   | 50000 |
| Feb   | 60000 |
| Mar   | 75000 |

Dashboard shows:

* Growth trend
* Best month
* Total sales
* Comparison chart

This helps managers understand performance quickly.

# 8. Example Python Code

## Bar Chart Dashboard

```python id="jlwmz9"
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    "Month": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"],
    "Sales": [50000, 60000, 75000, 70000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)

plt.bar(df["Month"], df["Sales"])
plt.title("Monthly Sales Dashboard")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Sales")
plt.show()
```

---

# 9. Line Chart Code

```python id="0g1thx"
plt.plot(df["Month"], df["Sales"], marker="o")
plt.title("Sales Trend")
plt.show()
```

---

# 10. Pie Chart Code

```python id="r7jzt8"
plt.pie(df["Sales"], labels=df["Month"], autopct="%1.1f%%")
plt.title("Sales Share")
plt.show()
```
